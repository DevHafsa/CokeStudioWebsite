             After musical performances were performed on a concert-like platform in Brazil in 2007, Nadeem Zaman of The Coca-Cola Company came up with the idea for the event. 
             In 2008, former Vital Signs member Rohail Hyatt teamed up with Nadeem Zaman, then Marketing Head of The Coca-Cola Company, to establish a Pakistani version of the show. 
             The first season premiered in front of a live audience on June 8, 2008. 
             He along with his wife Umber Hyatt and Nofil Naqvi produced the show. 
             Now there are 14 seasons and 76 episodes. 
             Featuring various artists from all over Pakistan.</p>
