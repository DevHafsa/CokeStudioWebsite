				Coke Studio is a Pakistani television show and international music
				franchise that features studio-recorded music performances by well-known
				and up-and-coming musicians. It is Pakistan's longest-running annual
				television music show and has aired since 2008.
			</p>
			<p class="text-align">
				From traditional classical, folk, Sufi, qawwali, ghazal, and bhangra
				music to current hip hop, rock, and pop music, Coke Studio incorporates
				diverse musical influences. The music shows Pakistan's multiculturalism
				by bringing together musicians from different parts of the country.

				After musical performances were performed on a concert-like platform in
				Brazil in 2007, Nadeem Zaman of The Coca-Cola Company came up with the
				idea for the event. In 2008, former Vital Signs member Rohail Hyatt
				teamed up with Nadeem Zaman, then Marketing Head of The Coca-Cola
				Company, to establish a Pakistani version of the show. The first season
				premiered in front of a live audience on June 8, 2008. He along with his
				wife Umber Hyatt and Nofil Naqvi produced the show.

				It became popular right away, winning praise from critics and routinely
				airing on many radio and television stations around the nation. Live
				audiences were excluded in season 2 and performances took place in a
				closed studio platform, a format that is still used today. Until season
				6, Hyatt served as the show's executive producer before stepping out in
				2013. Before Strings confirmed that season 10 would be their final
				production on October 29, 2017, he was replaced by members Bilal Maqsood
				and Faisal Kapadia. Season 11 will be produced by Ali Hamza and Zohaib
				Kazi, it was revealed on March 8th, 2018. After producing the season,
				they resigned. Later, Rohail Hyatt made a comeback for the show's
				twelfth season, which premiered on October 11, 2019. Hyatt kept things
				going through the 13th season, and on his advice, Xulfi took the helm
				for the 14th season with Abdullah Siddiqui serving as the associate
				producer, with Hyatt once more giving the lead.

				In 2017, on the occasion of the show's tenth anniversary, Rizwan U.
				Khan, General Manager of Coca-Cola Pakistan & Afghanistan, said, "We
				have come a long way since we embarked on this challenging journey a
				decade ago. Looking back, we feel greatly humbled that Coke Studio has
				been able to achieve so much, in terms of bringing virtually unknown or
				little-known musicians into the national limelight, re-introducing music
				genres like qawwali and Sufi music to the youth of Pakistan, continuing
				to stay true to the promise of producing quality fusion of music and
				practice playing an important role in reviving the music industry of
				Pakistan."
